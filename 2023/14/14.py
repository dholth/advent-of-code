The parabolic reflector dish deforms, but not in a way that focuses the beam. To
do that, you'll need to move the rocks to the edges of the platform.
Fortunately, a button on the side of the control panel labeled "spin cycle"
attempts to do just that!

Each cycle tilts the platform four times so that the rounded rocks roll north,
then west, then south, then east. After each tilt, the rounded rocks roll as far
as they can before the platform tilts in the next direction. After one cycle,
the platform will have finished rolling the rounded rocks in those four
directions in that order.
